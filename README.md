# Face-Recognition-attendence-management-system

 
The Attendance Management System aims to simplify attendance management processes with 
facial recognition technology for accuracy of attendance and security and performance in 
schools and workplace settings. The system will highlight elements of real time face detection 
and secure anomalies, with many aspects for student management, marking attendance, 
reporting and exporting attendance data to Excel, CSV and MySQL database. The system has 
been developed to also eliminate manual error and impersonating the real person, maintain 
information to privacy consent parameters, and to remain flexible for future development of 
enhancements and scalability.
